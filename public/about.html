<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello, my name's Melissa and I'm new to the web development world. It's what I strive for to be able to produce something different with a lot of passion, and vision. 
  Apart from my passion for development, I'm also fond of other hobbies such as painting, drawing and reading. 
  I am a freak for nature so when I am not indoors I always find something to do outdoors. In order to sit and relax, it's usually either hiking or driving around looking for the perfect scenery in nature.</p>

<p> Spending time with my family, friends and fur babies is more important than anything else as there's only so much life left. 
  I'm sharing my passion for gaming with friends in order to connect at this busy time of our lives. 
  One of my dreams is to create a business in order to help people have the best websites for their businesses, and assist them with learning these development skills at less cost so that they can become more economically viable.</p>
